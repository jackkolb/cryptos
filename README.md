## Cryptos

Scan various crypto exchanges to see if there are any profitable trades. Only looks at the ETH/USD pairing.

To scan from the command line:

`python main.py`

To open a simple GUI equivalent:

`python gui.py`

When I wrote this script in 2019, I did not expect most of the 10 exchanges used would be defunct by now.
